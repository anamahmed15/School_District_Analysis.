# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to evaluate the performance of each school and budget analysis across the disctrict. During one analysis, some dishonesty was found for the reading and math scores for Thomas High School, and so we completed the analysis again without the data for math and reading for 9th graders from Thomas High School.
## Deliverables
* A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics
* An overview of the key metrics for each school
* Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
  * Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  * The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
  * The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
  * School performance based on the budget per student
  * School performance based on the school size
  * School performance based on the type of school
## Results

## Summary
Let's compare the tampered school data with the new school data gathered.

Before data cleanup

* Average Math Score = 79.0
* Average Reading Score = 81.9
* % Passing Math 75
* % Passing Reading 86
* % Overall Passing 65

After data cleanup

* Average Math Score = 78.9
* Average Reading Score = 81.9
* % Passing Math 74.8
* % Passing Reading 85.7
* % Overall Passing 64.9

This also resulted in Thomas High School not being in the top 5 best performancing schools in the district anymore.

Overall Passing marks changes and difference for each students funding is approximately $200. 

Updated school district analysys data by replacing reading and math Scores for Thomas High School 9th Grade with NaNs.
